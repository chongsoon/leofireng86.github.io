"Hello World", the first two words to print when learning new programming languages.

```c#
//C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!!!");
```

Welcome to my first blog post! I am a tech geek and gamer. I would be sharing my thoughts related to technology and games in this blog. If possible, I would also be using this blog to showcase some of my coding experiments.

I had a Github account for quite a while but never used it until now. I would be using it to store some of my projects. Lately, I am quite interested in Javascript. I am currently following some course online relating to Javascript Design Patterns.

Anyways, I will be off dabbling. Will be back real soon.
